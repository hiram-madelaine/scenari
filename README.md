# Scenari - Executable Specification / BDD in Clojure

Scenari is an Executable Specification [Clojure](http://clojure.org/) library aimed at writing and executing usage scenarios following the [Behavior-Driven Development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development) - BDD - style. It has an [external DSL](http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/DomainSpecificLanguage.html), following the [gherkin grammar](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Gherkin) (in short: Given/When/Then), and execute each scenario's _steps_ with associated Clojure code.

## Basic Usage


### Write Scenarios in plain text
First, write your scenarios in plain text using the [Gherkin grammar]((https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Gherkin)) in a file or String :
You can add a "narrrative" for all your scenarios with the story syntax at the beginning of the story file (As a role I want to do something In order to get value)
```Gherkin
Scenario: create a new product
# this is a comment
When I create a new product with name "iphone 6" and description "awesome phone"
Then I receive a response with an id 56422 and a location URL
# this a second comment
# on two lines
When I invoke a GET request on location URL
Then I receive a 200 response

Scenario: get product info
When I invoke a GET request on location URL
Then I receive a 200 response
```

### Declaring a specification 

```clojure
(require 'scenari.v2.core :refer [deffeature])

(deffeature my-specification "./path/to/feature/file") ;; define deftest bound to symbol 'my-specification', put the specification as clojure data-structure in metadata and return the specification
;;=> 
;;{:scenarios [{:id "0ef9b8a9-e035-4ae2-96c4-662c0b8988de",
;;		:pre-run (),
;;		:post-run (),
;;		:scenario-name " create a new product",
;;		:steps [{:sentence-keyword :when,
;;			 :sentence "I create a new product with name \"iphone 6\" and description \"awesome phone\"",
;;			 :raw "When I create a new product with name \"iphone 6\" and description \"awesome phone\"",
;;			 :params [{:type :value, :val "iphone 6"} {:type :value, :val "awesome phone"}],
;;			 :order 0,
;;			 :glue nil}
;;			 ...steps]}
;;	        ...scenarios ],
;; :pre-run ()}
```
### Write glue-code

Then write the code that will get executed for each scenario steps:

```clojure

(require 'scenari.v2.core :refer [defwhen defthen])

(defwhen "I create a new product with name {string} and description {string}"
[_ name desc]
  (println "executing my product creation function with params " name desc)
  (let [id (UUID/next.)]
  	{:id (UUID/next. ) 
  	 :name name 
  	 :desc desc 
  	 :qty (rand-int 50) 
  	 :location-url (str "http://example.com/product/" id)}))


(defthen "I receive a response with an id {string}"
  [_ id]
  (println (str "executing the assertion that the product has been created with the id " id))
  id)
```

### Step expressions

A step's sentence matcher is a [cucumber expression](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-expressions): `{int}` `{float}` `{word}` `{string}`, optional text `apple(s)`, alternation `hot/cold`. `{number}` is not a cucumber type — scenari defines it, so the glues written before still work, and it now accepts a sign and decimals. A glue defined with a `#"..."` literal stays a plain regex whatever it contains, matching the whole sentence, and its capture groups become the arguments — make a group non-capturing (`(?:a|b)`) if it is only there to group. A *string* sentence wrapped in `^...$` or `/.../` is read as a regex too.

A literal `/`, `(` or `)` in a sentence must be escaped, or it reads as alternation or optional text:

```clojure
(defthen "the folders {string} \\/ {string} exist" [state a b] ...)
```

**Tips**: you can get a function snippet generated for you when executing the spec without step function. Think about enclosing with quote 'your data' in step sentence to get them detected by the parser and it'll generate a step function skeleton in the output with the correct sentence matcher group.
Example: 

Executing the specification with the step sentence without any matching function:

```gherkin
When I create a new product with name "iphone 6" and description "awesome phone"
```

will generate in the stdout the following step function skeleton:

```
Missing step for : When I create a new product with name "iphone 6" and description "awesome phone"
(defwhen "I create a new product with name {string} and description {string}"  [state arg0 arg1]  (do "something"))
```

### how to get data from the scenario into your step function

One argument per token of the sentence matcher, left to right, after the state — and each token converts its capture: `{int}` gives a number, `{string}` the text without its quotes, `{word}` a String. The sentence's own literals are not read: what a step receives is what its tokens capture.

A datatable or a doc string is appended after those, as one more argument: a vector of maps for the table, the string for the doc string.


### Execute scenario(s)
 There is three-way to execute scenarios, depending on your situation

#### Tree execution
Declaring your specification using `scenari.v2.core/deffeature` returns the parsed specification as clojure data structure. By using `scenari.v2.core/run-scenario`, the specification as data will be ran

```Clojure
(require 'scenari.v2.core :refer [run-feature run-features])
(run-feature #'my-specification)

;;OR
(require 'scenari.v2.core :refer [run-scenarios])
(run-features #'my-specification)
```

The execution report will be returned, rely on same clojure data-structure returned by `scenari.v2.core/deffeature`. Will set : 
- final `:status` of scenario(s) execution
- step `:status` as `pending` when not executed, `failed` when assertions fail or exception thrown, `success` at last
- step `:input-state` as the value returned by the previous step executed (empty map for the first one)  
- step `:output-state` as the value returned by the current step

This method is useful for debugging.

#### Clojure-test execution
Use clojure-test reporting system by printing execution. 

```clojure
(require 'scenari.v2.test :refer [run-feature])
(run-feature #'my-specification)
;; ________________________
;; @checkout
;; Feature : shopping cart
;;   A cart holds items and can be emptied.
;;
;; @edge-case
;; Testing scenario : removing too much
;;   Given a cart with 2 items         (from user/"a cart with {number} items")
;;   When I remove 5 items         (from user/"I remove {number} items")
;;   Step failed
;; java.lang.AssertionError: Assert failed: cannot remove 5 from 2
;;   Then the cart holds 0 items         (from user/"the cart holds {number} items")
;; removing too much FAILED
;;
;; ________________________
```

Output is colorized following the gherkin syntax: keywords in bold cyan, `{string}`
and `{number}` parameters in yellow, and the sentence itself in green, red or grey
depending on whether the step passed, failed or never ran. Tags are cyan, free
descriptions, docstrings and datatables grey. Coloring honours kaocha's
`--color` / `--no-color`, so a piped or CI run can be kept plain.
Useful to integrate a feature in a clojure test namespace


#### Kaocha runner
Kaocha is a test runner and handle test phase lifecycle. 

By defining a test type in your kaocha configuration file (`tests.edn` by default) like this  
```clojure
#kaocha/v1
        {:tests [{:id                                :scenario
                  :type                              :kaocha.type/scenari
                  :kaocha/source-paths               ["src"]
                  :kaocha/test-paths                 ["test/scenario"]
                  :kaocha.type.scenari/glue-paths    ["test/scenario/glue"]}]}
```
You are able to launch your scenario using kaocha repl utility function

```clojure
(require 'kaocha.repl :as krepl)
(krepl/run :scenario)

;; Testing scenario : create a new product
;;   When I invoke a GET request on location URL         (from scenari.v2.glue/"I invoke a GET request on location URL")
;;   When I create a new product with name "iphone 6" and description "awesome phone" with properties         (from scenari.v2.glue/"I create a new product with name {string} and description {string} with properties")
;;       | size | weight |
;;       | 6    | 2      |
;;   Then I receive a response with an id 56422         (from scenari.v2.glue/"I receive a response with an id {number}")
;;   Then a location URL         (from scenari.v2.glue/"a location URL")
;; 
;; 
;; 1 tests, 1 assertions, 0 failures.
;; => #:kaocha.result{:count 1, :pass 1, :error 0, :fail 0, :pending 0}
```
Suitable when using kaocha to manage test lifecycle.

### Using hooks
By providing an options maps in `scenari.v2.core/deffeature`, you can specify function which execute :
- `:pre-run` before feature execution
- `:post-run` after feature executed
- `:pre-scenario-run` before each scenario execution
- `:post-scenaro-run` after each scenario executed
Example:

```Clojure
(require 'scenari.v2.core :refer [deffeature])

(defn before-all [] (prn "init feature components"))
(defn before-each [] (prn "init scenario components"))
(defn after-each [] (prn "clean scenario side effects"))
(defn clean [] (prn "reset and shut down components"))

(deffeature my-specification "./path/to/feature/file"
			{:pre-run           [#'before-all]
			 :pre-scenario-run  [#'before-each]
			 :post-scenario-run [#'after-each]
			 :post-run          [#'clean]})
```

### Provide an initial state
For each scenario execution, an initial state can be provided within the options map of `deffeature`.

Example:

```clojure
(deffeature my-specification "./path/to/feature/file"
			{:default-scenario-state {:foo "bar"}})
```
By default, the scenario state is an empty map `{}`.

## Documentation 

### Development Workflow
The [Development Workflow Guide](doc/development-workflow.md) provides a comprehensive overview of the full development cycle when using Scenari. It covers writing feature files, defining features in code, implementing step definitions, and understanding how execution works.

### Internal Feature Structure
The [Feature Structure Documentation](doc/feature-structure.md) provides a detailed explanation of the internal data structure used to represent features, scenarios, and steps in Scenari. This is particularly useful when extending or customizing Scenari.

### Declaring same step (glue-code) but different namespace
Sometimes, you have to declare the same step (using the sentence matcher) but for different context (domain or component level for exemple).

TODO Put an exemple about step proximity resolution

### Macros (deprecated)
There are 3 macros available for given/when/then:

```clojure
;; a sentence for matching a step in the scenarios
;; a params vector: 
;;    the first param is the return of the previous step (nil if first step)
;;    then one param for each sentence group (aka. something in parens (...)) you define.
;; a body function.

(defgiven sentence-matcher params body)
(defwhen sentence-matcher params body)
(defthen sentence-matcher params body)
```

Macros are here for convenience, plain-old function are also available, you have to provide the step execution function as parameters with the function having groups count + 1 parameters (one for the previous step return and one params for each groups in the sentence matcher).

```clojure
(ns mystuff
  (:require [spexec :as spec]))
...
(Given sentence-matcher fn)
(When sentence-matcher fn)
(Then sentence-matcher fn)
```

### Chaining steps 
Steps often produce side effect or retrieve some stuffs (fn, data) to be used in the next ones, you can store your state in your code or in the scenario itself, but I think an easier mechanism is to think of the steps like a chain and pass a data structure from the return of a step to the input of the next one (very similar to [ring handlers](https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring/wiki/Concepts) or chain of responsibility for instance). So, each step function's return is taken as the input for the next step as the first argument (you can name it `_` if you don't need it). A good practice would be to use a map or vector and then destructure it as the first param of the next step, like :

```clojure
(defwhen "my sentence to be matched with {string} and {string}" 
         [[key1-in-previous-result k2] param1 param2] 
         (do-something param1 k2 param2) ...)
```

### Advanced usage (deprecated)

I use Spexec to test Spexec (yes it eats its own dog food, pretty amazing :-) only a dynamic language like Lisp can do that as easily), only the bootstrap step "Given the step function" is needed:

```gherkin
Scenario: a scenario that test spexec using spexec
Given the step function: (defgiven (re-pattern "^this scenario in a file named (.*)") [_ feature-file-name] [feature-file-name])
Given the step function: (defwhen (re-pattern "^I run the scenarios with '(.+)'") [prev-ret my-data] (conj prev-ret (str "processed" my-data)))
Given the step function: (defthen (re-pattern "^I should get '(.+)' from scenario file '(.*)' returned from the previous when step") [prev-ret expected-data scenario-file] (clojure.test/is (= (last prev-ret) expected-data))(clojure.test/is (= (first prev-ret) scenario-file)))
Given this scenario in a file named resources/spexec.feature
When I run the scenarios with 'mydatavalues'
Then I should get 'processedmydatavalues' from scenario file 'resources/spexec.feature' returned from the previous when step
```

```clojure
(defgiven "the step function: {string}" [_ step-fn]
   (eval (read-string step-fn)))
```

### Run the scenarios with each steps

### Logging

## Rationale

I'm used to [JBehave](http://jbehave.org/) and I wanted a BDD framework with an [external DSL](http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/DomainSpecificLanguage.html) following the [gherkin grammar](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Gherkin) but also with an easy and fast setup and with steps written in [Clojure](http://clojure.org/). The previous BDD attempt I known in Clojure were all with an [internal DSL](http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/DomainSpecificLanguage.html). I prefer an external one because I think it's easier to share the scenarios with a domain expert. I you prefer an internal DSL BDD Framework, have a look at [Speclj](http://speclj.com/).

Proper compatibility with traditional clojure.test interfaces is needed, for instance we could make the following relations between Scenari/BDD concepts and clojure.test:
- A scenario execution is like a `deftest`. Particularly, we need to associate steps with Gherkin scenarios defined in one or more feature files. For that we would define this association between steps (`defgiven`, `defwhen` and `defthen`) and scenarios with `(defscenarios "my.feature")`. The execution would then be run with `(run-scenarios)` much like `(run-tests)`. In case of examples table used to feed the scenario with data, each data row would be associated with a new testing context for each steps (the `testing` context description would be the steps sentence with all data placeholder replaced with the actual ones).
- A scenario's step is like a `testing` context inside a `deftest`. 
Also, steps and scenarios association must be isolated within namespace to avoid collisions when the same scenarios are used with different steps (like ones for domain test, others for integration testing, etc.).
The compatibility with clojure.test would also be with its various reports available (`:pass`, `:fail`, etc.) with reports specific to narrative, scenarios and steps. 
Concerning assertion, steps could contains `clojure.test/is` assertions or throws exception that will be handled properly like clojure.test ones. 

Feature files are parsed by [`io.cucumber/gherkin`](https://github.com/cucumber/gherkin), the reference implementation, so scenari reads what Cucumber reads: the ~70 languages, `Rule`, tags on `Examples`, doc string content types. The *step sentence* — the half gherkin does not cover, the one that binds a sentence to Clojure code — is a [cucumber expression](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-expressions), matched and generated by cucumber's own implementation.

I did a presentation of the internals of the library at the Clojure Paris User Group and the slides are here: ["Anatomy of a BDD Execution Library in Clojure"](https://speakerdeck.com/jgrodziski/anatomy-of-a-bdd-execution-library-in-clojure).

## TODOS

Gaps against Cucumber, roughly by value/effort.

### Step expressions

* [ ] custom parameter types: the `ParameterTypeRegistry` is in `glue.clj`, it needs a public way to add one
* [ ] a datatable API beyond a vector of string maps: lists, transpose, diff, row-to-entity conversion

### Execution

* [ ] `--dry-run`: glues are already resolved at parse time, so this is mostly a matter of reporting the resolution
* [ ] an unresolved step should be `:undefined`, not the NPE `run-step` raises by calling `(apply nil ...)`
* [ ] stop-on-failure? as an option for execution
* [ ] rerun only the scenarios that failed, `--retry n` for flaky ones
* [x] a gherkin `@parallel` tag: a feature carrying it runs in the background (a future) while the rest of the suite keeps going, instead of blocking the next feature -- untagged features (the default) stay exactly as sequential as before. Each feature already carries its own independent AST and hooks, so nothing shared needs to change to make this safe at the scheduling level. Not compatible with `--fail-fast` for a tagged feature (already started, it cannot be cancelled). Each feature's output is buffered and flushed as one block to limit interleaving, though it is not airtight yet: kaocha's own output-capture plugin rebinds `*out*` independently, so a tagged feature's lines can still interleave with an untagged one running at the same moment -- cosmetic, not a correctness issue (pass/fail is unaffected), but worth knowing before reading a colored run at a glance. Hooks and glue code that touch a shared external resource (a database, a Solr collection...) must be made safe for concurrent use before tagging a feature -- the library does not isolate them for you, and a real suite with cross-feature shared state (an in-progress benchmark on one found FK violations and Solr contamination) should stay untagged until that isolation exists

### Reporting

* [ ] measure step and scenario durations -- nothing is timed today, which also blocks a slowest-steps report
* [ ] cucumber-messages / JSON output, the interchange format the whole ecosystem reads (Allure, Cucumber Reports, CI). The parser already speaks it: a feature is read as `Envelope` messages, only the run needs to emit its own
* [ ] usage report: which glues ran, which are dead
* [ ] attachments (screenshots) from a step or a hook

### Hooks

* [ ] step-level hooks, and suite-level before-all / after-all
* [ ] tag-conditional hooks (`@before "@web and not @slow"`)
* [ ] pass the scenario -- name, tags, status -- to the hook, which currently receives nothing
* [ ] hooks shared across features, instead of one options map per `deffeature`

### Gherkin

* [ ] a `Rule` level in the report and in the kaocha tree; rules are parsed but flattened into the feature

### Glue code

* [ ] give another way to declare steps without macro (proper defn with `:scenari/regex` in meta)

Deliberately out of scope: dependency injection (the chained scenario state
replaces it), IDE integration.
